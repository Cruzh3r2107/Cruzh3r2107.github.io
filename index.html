                    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                    <p>Hello readers,I am Vishwanath from Delhi, India, the capital city know for "Dilli dil walao ki hoti hai". I am also an Embedded Software Engineer with expertise in Linux, RTOS, and C++, specializing in sensor interfacing, microcontrollers, and embedded systems. With one year of experience, I have worked on projects that push computation closer to the edge.</p>
                    
                    <h3>My Journey</h3>
                    <p>Watching a ton of sci-fi and a passion for opening up my RC cars, finding a cute board at the center 
                        of it all and only to realize that I did not know how to put it back together was a 11year old kid from 
                        India. I saw a movie called 3 idiots which was a story of 3 engineers finding their way through 4 years 
                        of engineering. one of the characters named Rancho stuck with me, this character was relatable like 
                        no other. This is when I realized that my curiosity led me to become engineering. I pursued 
                        computer and communication engineering at Amrita University, Coimbatore and coming for masters 
                        at UC Irvine in EECS department has the best future for me.
                        Programming and physics became my prime interests which formed the base of computer and 
                        communication engineering was special for me. My curiosity and drive to learn about how chips 
                        formed circuits, to form systems and how they were programmed kept me on my toes. I took 
                        summer courses on robotics; worked on controllers to run a motor, which was used to move a toy 
                        car. To learn what I could do more with programming I took C++ in high school and along with 
                        physics about circuits and electronics paved the path to electronics engineering. The curriculum at 
                        Amrita University was distributed and provided me with a plethora of knowledge in courses like 
                        wireless communication, computer networks, cyber physical systems, and the Internet of Things 
                        enthralled me. With all that I had learnt coupled with my innate interest to explore the nuances of 
                        the industry, I had observed a drastic yet consistent sophistication in electronic products and 
                        services across the world. I also loved developing projects that positively affect the society as a 
                        whole because of which I worked on a project that involved recognising a facial feature and giving a
                        voice output to the user if the person is known or unknown. It also detects distance and the object 
                        that is in front of the visually impaired person. 
                        For my senior year, I came to UCI and the experience until now has been overwhelming; getting to 
                        know new people, new cultures, working under new professors and learning about the electronic 
                        industry here. It has been an enjoyable experience and the program has given me a different 
                        perspective to both engineering and education. Faculty here are really experienced and have a vast 
                        knowledge and were kind enough to mentor my team to improve on the project I has worked on and 
                        that’s why I believed that UCI could provide me the best platform to achieve my goals add to the 
                        reputation for this University.
                        Electronics engineering has become my dream with everything I have encountered and learnt it has 
                        changed to becoming a goal of mine. Thats why i decided to pursue a masters in embedded systems from UC Irvine and it did enhance 
                        my understanding of the subject and give me the edge I require to become a successful engineer in 
                        this field. Dealing with all the competition and challenges in this field as made me extract each drop 
                        of opportunity I can get.</p>
                    
                    <h3>My Approach</h3>
                    <p>I believe in learning through hands-on experience and continuously pushing the boundaries of embedded technology. My goal is to drive innovation in healthcare by leveraging my expertise in embedded systems and real-time computing.</p>
